# Thronekeeper - Universal AI Model Routing for VS Code

**Seamlessly use any AI model provider with Claude Code and other Anthropic-compatible clients.**

Thronekeeper is a powerful VS Code extension that acts as an intelligent proxy, allowing you to use OpenRouter, OpenAI, Together AI, Groq, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint with tools that expect the Anthropic API format.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Universal Model Access
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Connect to OpenRouter (400+ models), OpenAI, Together AI, Groq, or custom endpoints
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically translates between Anthropic and OpenAI API formats
- **Three-Model Mode**: Use different models for reasoning (complex tasks), completion (coding), and value (efficiency)
- **Provider Memory**: Model selections persist per provider - switch seamlessly between services

### 🔐 Security First
- **Secure Credential Storage**: API keys stored in VS Code's secure keychain, never in plain text
- **Workspace Isolation**: Settings can be scoped to workspace or global level
- **Anthropic Bypass**: Direct routing for Anthropic-compatible endpoints without proxy overhead

### 🎨 Modern UI Experience
- **Interactive Panel**: Beautiful configuration panel in VS Code's bottom panel area
- **Real-Time Model Loading**: Browse and search available models from each provider
- **Popular Pairings**: Pre-configured model combinations for optimal performance
- **Live Status Monitoring**: See proxy status, selected models, and health checks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
1. Install from VS Code Marketplace or download the `.vsix` file
2. Open the Thronekeeper panel: **View → Panel → Thronekeeper**
3. Select your AI provider and add your API key
4. Choose your models and click **Start Proxy**
5. Claude Code will automatically use your configured models!

### Basic Usage

#### OpenRouter (Recommended)
Access 400+ models including GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and more:
1. Select "OpenRouter" as provider
2. Get your API key from [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
3. Browse models or use popular pairings
4. Start proxy - done!

#### OpenAI
Use GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and o1 models:
1. Select "OpenAI" as provider
2. Add your OpenAI API key
3. Select from available GPT models
4. Start proxy

#### Custom Provider
Connect to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint:
1. Select "Custom" as provider
2. Enter your endpoint URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com/v1`)
3. Add your API key
4. Enter model IDs manually or load from endpoint
5. Start proxy

## 🎮 Commands

Access these commands via the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`):

- `Thronekeeper: Open Panel` - Open the configuration panel
- `Thronekeeper: Start Proxy` - Start the proxy server
- `Thronekeeper: Stop Proxy` - Stop the proxy server
- `Thronekeeper: Show Status` - Display current proxy status
- `Thronekeeper: Apply to Claude Code` - Configure Claude Code to use the proxy
- `Thronekeeper: Revert Claude Code` - Restore original Claude Code settings

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Extension Settings

- `claudeThrone.provider` - Default AI provider (openrouter, openai, together, grok, custom)
- `claudeThrone.twoModelMode` - Enable three-model mode with separate models for reasoning, completion, and value tasks
- `claudeThrone.reasoningModel` - Primary model for complex reasoning tasks
- `claudeThrone.completionModel` - Model for code generation and balanced tasks
- `claudeThrone.valueModel` - Model for fast operations and simple tasks
- `claudeThrone.proxy.port` - Proxy server port (default: 3000)
- `claudeThrone.autoApply` - Auto-configure Claude Code on proxy start
- `claudeThrone.applyScope` - Settings scope (workspace or global)
- `claudeThrone.customBaseUrl` - Custom provider endpoint URL

### Three-Model Mode

Optimize performance by using three specialized models:
- **Reasoning Model**: Complex analysis, planning, debugging (e.g., GPT-4, Claude Opus)
- **Completion Model**: Code generation, balanced tasks (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet)
- **Value Model**: Fast operations, simple tasks (e.g., GPT-3.5, Claude Haiku)

### Feature Flags

Thronekeeper includes internal feature flags that control advanced behavior. These are enabled by default and generally should not need modification:

- `enableSchemaValidation` (default: `true`) - Validates messages between webview and extension to ensure data integrity
- `enableTokenValidation` (default: `true`) - Prevents race conditions by validating request/response sequence tokens
- `enableKeyNormalization` (default: `true`) - Normalizes provider map keys to canonical format
- `enablePreApplyHydration` (default: `true`) - Ensures global model settings are synchronized before proxy starts

These flags are primarily for debugging and development. In normal usage, they should remain at their default values. To modify them, add the following to your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "claudeThrone.featureFlags": {
    "enableSchemaValidation": true,
    "enableTokenValidation": true,
    "enableKeyNormalization": true,
    "enablePreApplyHydration": true
  }
}
```

**Note**: Disabling these flags may result in unexpected behavior and is not recommended for production use.

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Provider-Specific Model Persistence
Models are saved per provider, so switching between OpenRouter and OpenAI maintains your selections for each.

### Anthropic Endpoint Detection
Custom URLs pointing to Anthropic-compatible services bypass the proxy for direct connection.

### Manual Model Entry
If a custom provider can't list models, enter them manually with comma-separated IDs.

### Health Monitoring
The proxy includes health checks with automatic recovery and detailed logging.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Unable to connect to API"
- Check that the proxy is running (green status in panel)
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check the Output panel for detailed logs

### Models not loading
- Ensure you have a valid API key stored
- For custom providers, verify the endpoint URL
- Try entering model IDs manually if auto-loading fails

### Proxy won't start
- Check if port 3000 (or configured port) is available
- Look for errors in the Output panel (Thronekeeper channel)
- Try stopping and restarting the proxy
